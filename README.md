# Eidos: The AI-Powered Command Line for Linux

Eidos is a revolutionary command-line interface (CLI) that brings the power of natural language processing to your Linux terminal. Built with Rust, Eidos leverages large language models (LLMs) to provide a more intuitive and efficient way to interact with your system. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a command-line novice, Eidos will help you get more done with less effort.

## Features

*   **Natural Language Interface:** Interact with your terminal in plain English (or any other language). No need to memorize complex commands or syntax.
*   **Intelligent Command Execution:** Eidos understands your requests and translates them into the appropriate shell commands, saving you time and reducing errors.
*   **Web Search Integration:** Seamlessly search the web directly from the command line. Get the information you need without ever leaving your terminal.
*   **Safe and Secure:** Eidos is built with Rust, a language known for its safety and performance. You can trust Eidos to execute commands securely and efficiently.

## General Architecture

Eidos is built on a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and customization. The key components are:

*   **Interaction Interface:** The main entry point for the CLI application. It handles user input, manages the conversation history, and displays the output.
*   **Translation Agent:** This component is responsible for language detection, prompt optimization, and translation. It takes the user's natural language input and prepares it for the AI model.
*   **Decider Bridge:** The Decider Bridge is the brain of the operation. It analyzes the optimized prompt and determines which AI agent is best suited for the task.
*   **Executioner:** This component is responsible for executing the shell commands generated by the AI. It includes robust input sanitization and error handling to ensure safe and reliable execution.
*   **Explorer:** The Explorer provides the functionality to conduct internet searches. It uses the Llama API to fetch and display search results directly in the terminal.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run Eidos, you will need the following:

*   **Rust:** Eidos is built with Rust. You can install it from the official website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
*   **Cargo:** Cargo is the Rust package manager. It is included with the Rust installation.
*   **Git:** You will need Git to clone the Eidos repository.

### Building and Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/eidos.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd eidos
    ```

3.  **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    ./target/release/eidos
    ```

## Usage

Using Eidos is as simple as typing a command in plain English. For example:

*   `eidos list all files in the current directory`
*   `eidos search for "rust lang" on the web`
*   `eidos create a new directory called "my-project"`

Eidos will interpret your request, generate the appropriate command, and execute it for you.
